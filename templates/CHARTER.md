# CHARTER: [Initiative Name]

<!--
  CHARTER documents are strategic framing artifacts.
  They define purpose and priorities, not solutions.

  Explore in sketches; frame in the charter.

  See: workflows/charter.md for the full protocol specification.
-->

## Purpose

<!-- What problem in the world does this solve? Who has the problem? Not a feature list. -->

## North Star

<!-- What does full success look like? Not a milestone — the long-term outcome. -->

## Workstreams

<!--
  Ordered priorities. Each workstream spawns an independent sketch→plan→core cycle.
  A workstream should be independently explorable — if it's too large, it's a sub-charter;
  if it's too small, it's a plan item.
-->

   - Status: [Not Started | In Progress | Complete]

## Non-Goals

<!--
  Strategic exclusions — what this initiative deliberately won't address and WHY.
  These are different from plan-level non-goals (which are tactical and phase-scoped).
  A good strategic non-goal explains the reasoning, not just the exclusion.

## Appetite

<!--
  How much investment is this worth? Not a deadline — an honest assessment of
  tolerance. If the work exceeds the appetite, descope rather than push harder.

  Examples: "A weekend exploration", "2-3 focused sketch cycles",
  "A major multi-month commitment with dedicated attention"
