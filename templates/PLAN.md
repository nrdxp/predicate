# PLAN: [Topic]

<!--
  PLAN documents are structured procedures for /core execution.
  They should be professional, complete, and ready to hand off.

  Iterate in your sketch; commit in the plan.

  See: workflows/plan.md for the full protocol specification.
-->

## Goal

<!-- One paragraph: what we're doing and why. Be specific. -->

## Constraints

<!-- Non-negotiable external limits. Different from Out of Scope (our choice). -->

- ...

## Decisions

<!-- Key decisions with rationale. Keep rationale brief; detailed analysis belongs in the sketch. -->

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
| :------- | :----- | :-------- |
| ...      | ...    | ...       |

## Scope

### In Scope

- ...

### Out of Scope

- ...

## Phases

<!--
  Phases are nested task lists. Depth should match complexity.
  Each phase should be independently valuable (Phase 1 useful even if Phase 2 fails).
  Each phase should be executable as a bounded /core invocation.
-->

1. **Phase 1: [Name]** — [objective]
   - Deliverable 1
   - Deliverable 2

2. **Phase 2: [Name]** — [objective]
   - Deliverable 1
     - Sub-task if needed
     - Sub-task if needed
   - Deliverable 2

## Verification

<!-- Testable checkpoints. How do we know we're done? -->

- [ ] Checkpoint 1
- [ ] Checkpoint 2
