# Suite for the typed-claim extractor (ledger/derive/extract_entries.py) and
# the query over its export (ledger/derive/entries_query.ncl).
#
# The extractor is TRUSTED MACHINERY: a query result is `proved` only relative
# to extractor fidelity, so its fixture suite is golden-vector-driven:
#
#   - CENSUS goldens: graded documents publish their own token census in a §7
#     fenced block (the output of the two commands their legend states). The
#     extractor's --census must reproduce that block byte-for-byte, and the
#     expected block is read FROM THE FIXTURE ITSELF — the golden is the
#     document's own published count, never a second copy that can go stale.
#   - EXTRACTION golden: a synthetic ledger-dialect fixture whose expected
#     JSON is exact by construction; the export must also pass the EXISTING
#     entry_apply.ncl (the extractor never re-implements the law).
#   - REPORT reds: malformed or partially-typed input is REPORTED with exit 3,
#     never silently skipped — a silently dropped node is a query result that
#     is confidently incomplete.
#
# Usage: test_entries_extract.sh
# Exit:  0 = every case matched, 1 = a case mismatched, 2 = environment error.
