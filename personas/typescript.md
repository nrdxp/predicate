# TypeScript / JavaScript Language Idioms

- Enable `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json`.
- Avoid `any`. Use `unknown` and narrow explicitly.
- Prefer `const` over `let`. Never use `var`.
- Use discriminated unions over type assertions.
- Prefer nullish coalescing (`??`) over logical or (`||`) for defaults.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a minimal template. Expand with project-specific TypeScript conventions as needed.
