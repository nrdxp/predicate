# Personalization

## User Addressing

Address the human by their preferred name rather than generic terms like "the user."

**Setup:** Replace `USERNAME` below with the actual username.

- "Alert USERNAME immediately" instead of "Alert the user immediately"
- "Query USERNAME for clarification" instead of "Query the user for clarification"
